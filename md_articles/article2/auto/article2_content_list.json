To meet the next-generation requirements of hydrogen production,advanced water electrolysis technologies that exhibit high energy efficiency,compact structure and much better gas separation have been extensively developed [6-8].Among them，AEMWE not only possesses high performance and safety,but also inherits low precious metal use and high contamination tolerance from traditional alkaline water electrolysis [9,1O].Therefore,the powerful and cost-effective AEMWE will be highly competitive in the future large-scale hydrogen production of water electrolysis [11,12].

Although many AEMWE cells show high current density,it is still a challenge to meet the requirement of industrial hydrogen production due to their limited durability.The durability of AEMWE mainly depends on the chemical stability of the AEMs in alkaline working condition.Although many efforts were devoted to the development of alkali-resistant AEMs in the past decade,few AEMWE cells equipped with the high-performance AEMachieved durable hydrogen production for more than $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ [4,9,17,18]. Therefore,high-performance and durable AEMs are urgently needed for industrial AEMWE development. ",

Unlike many polymers with electron-withdrawing groups (such as aryl ether bond,carbonyl group,sulfonyl group,etc.),the repeating unit of the PBPA backbone is a rigid biphenyl and a methine, which can effectively prevent the attack of hydroxide.Meanwhile, attaching trimethylamine cationic groups to the polymer backbone with a long alkyl side chain,the prepared polyelectrolyte can obtain good alkali stability [25-28].It should be a good candidate for the highlyefficient and durable AEMWE.Moreover,the synthesis is facial and cost-effective.

        "text": "In summary,this study demonstrated the application of PBPA in the water electrolysis for durable and highly-efficient hydrogen production. The PBPA was synthesized for both AEMand AEI.The AEI contents have great effects on the internal resistance of AEMWE cell,which initially decreases and then increases with the increment of the AEI contents.The cell with the optimal AEI contents of $7 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ (anode) and $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ (cathode) achieves high current densities of $2 . 8 \\mathrm { A }$ and $4 . 0 \\mathrm { A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ under $2 . 0 \\mathrm { V }$ in 1 M KOH solution at 60 and $8 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C }$ ,respectively.Meanwhile,the PBPA-based MEA has good water electrolysis performance in pure water and $\\mathrm { N a H C O _ { 3 } }$ solution.Moreover,the water electrolysis performance strongly depends on the KOH concentration and temperature.The PBPA-based AEMWE cell show excellent durable water electrolysis performance in 1 KOH solution at $1 . 0 \\mathrm { A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ and $6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ The cell voltage maintains around 1.9 V for over $3 5 0 0 \\mathrm { h }$ CCE test,with a rising rate of less than $6 . 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { V } ~ \\mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 }$ ．Therefore,the PBPA-based AEM and MEA show outstanding durabilityand efficiency in the AEMWE,and have a great potential for industrial hydrogen production via the AEMWE.
