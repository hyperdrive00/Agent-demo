Introducing bulky rigid aromatic structures into the polymer backbones can prevent chain stack and increase inner free volume to develop ionic transportability.However, the bulky aromatic groups tend to increase the membrane rigidity and brittleness,resulting in undesired mechanical properties [26].Many strategies, including side-chain grafting[27],crosslinking[28] and blending[29],have been used to limit water swelling and reinforce mechanical properties of these AEMs. ",

Zhu et al.investigated the effects of the length of the hydrophilic multi-cation crosslinker on membrane performance and discovered that hexyl spacers between polymer main chains and QA groups in the crosslinker could maintain a reasonable balance between high conductivity and moderate dimensional stability [31].Lee et al. prepared highly conductive,stable,and robust dual-piperidinium crosslinked polyaromatic-based AEMs by tuning the alkyl spacer in a crosslinker [32].Piperidinium cation group is prominently stable under a harsh alkaline condition owing to the low ring strain and effective steric protection provided by the symmetrical six-membered-ring structure.However,there is a significant variance in the alkaliresistant capability of piperidinium cations with different substituents. Up to now,there have been few publications on the effect of various crosslinkers containing piperidinium-based cation groups on the membrane properties.Therefore,enriching and optimizing the piperidiniumbased crosslinker through molecular structure design for advanced AEM materials is imperative.

Several new signalsappeared in the corresponding spectra, indicating that degradation occurred during the monitoring period.According to the $^ 1 \\mathrm { H }$ NMR spectrum analysis,additional degradation peaks appeared at 2.0-3.5 ppm,indicating that these dual-cation crosslinkers may have degraded via $S _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reaction,in which $\\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ ions attack the $\\mathsf { \\alpha { - } } \\mathsf { C }$ atoms on the dualcation crosslinkers.Possibly because the $\\alpha { - } \\mathrm { C }$ atoms directly connected to the N atom exhibit a more centralized positive distribution than the distant $\\beta$ -C atoms,implying that the nucleophile $\\left( \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - } \\right)$ can more easily attack the $\\mathsf { \\alpha { - } } \\mathsf { C }$ atoms [2O].The degradation degree of the cation compounds was calculated by the integral-area ratio of their characteristic peaks [17].As shown in Fig.1(d),both QDMP and QDHP showed only $3 . 7 \\%$ and $4 . 2 \\%$ degradation,respectively,after $4 8 0 \\mathrm { h }$ of exposure in a 5 M NaOH $\\mathrm { D _ { 2 } O / C D _ { 3 } O D }$ $( 1 { : } 3 \\ \\mathrm { \\ v o l } \\% )$ ）solution，whereas QDPP showed $1 0 . 5 \\%$ degradation under the same conditions.The pristine piperidinium group without substituents possesses special constrained ring conformation and can partly withstand the $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ attack.When electrondonating methyl groups appear on the C4-position of the piperidinium ring,the electron density of the functional group with positive charge further increases,efectively reducing the likelihood of $\\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ attack and greatly improving the alkaline stability of the piperidinium cation [17,36]. On the contrary, including electron-withdrawing phenyl substituent in the piperidinium ring can promote the cation degradation attacked by $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ resulting in a decrease in the chemical stability.The alkaline stability of these piperidinium-based crosslinkers herein can be ranked as $\\mathrm { Q D M P } > \\mathrm { Q D H P } > \\mathrm { Q D P P }$ ,and is in good accord with the report [1].
