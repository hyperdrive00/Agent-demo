        "text": "Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier for decarbonization and the storage of renewable electricity [1,2]．Water electrolysis driven by electricity from renewable energy sources to produce high-purity hydrogen without carbon emissions is deemed a sustainable method for realizing energy conversion and storage [3-5].The AEMWE presents distinguished advantages that combine the merits of mature alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) and burgeoning proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) [6,7].The zero-gap-assembly AEMWE cell with solid polymer electrolyte AEM allows for operations at high currentsand generates pressurized and high-purity hydrogen.Meanwhile, the alkaline work environment provides the possibility to use platinumgroup-metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts and inexpensive metal hardware [8-10].However,the AEM and ionomers,as the core components of AEMWE with unsatisfied anion exchange polyelectrolytes (AEPs),still do not guarantee high current density and longevity.Despite the fact that researchers have developed several commercial AEMs and anion exchange ionomers (AEIs)，such as Fumasep? FAA3，PiperION, AemionTM,Sustainion@,andOrionTM1,etc[11-13].However,higherperformance AEMs are strongly required for the practical application of AEMWE. ",

In addition,introducing a rigid, twisted structure into the main chain is considered an effective way to promote microphase separation and improve conductivity.For instance,the poly(terphenylene) with a metaterphenyl structure can effectively promote the ion conductivity to 112 $\\mathrm { m } s \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ at $8 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ ,higher than the p-terphenyl base poly(terphenylene) $( 8 1 ~ \\mathrm { m S ~ c m } ^ { - 1 } )$ [22].

Some research on AEM fuel cells (AEMFC) has proved that polyaromatic ionomers with non-rotatable phenyl-phenyl rings have smaller adsorption energies on catalysts,significantly improving AEMFC performance [19,23,24].In the field of AEMWE,the alkylammonium poly(carbazole)-based AEP QPC-TMA reached a state-of-the-art AEMWE performance of $3 . 5 \\mathrm { A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at $_ { 1 . 9 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ [18].The poly(fluorenyl-co-aryl piperidinium） (PFAP） presented impressive AEMWE current density of $7 . 6 8 \\mathrm { A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at $2 . 0 \\mathrm { V }$ in 1 M KOH[4].From these,it is seen that the non-rotatable aromatic structure is a good choice to construct a microphase separation structure and decrease interaction between the ionomer and catalyst.

        "text": "In this study,we presented a series of PFA-based AEMs combined with different contents of $p$ -terphenyl or biphenyl.The combination of fluorenyl and $p$ -terphenyl in PFTA has been demonstrated to help construct a well-defined microphase separation structure that facilitates ionic conduction.The PFTA-20 AEM presents a high $\\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ conductivity of $1 5 5 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { m S ~ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ with a low SR of $3 3 . 8 \\%$ and a high WU of $1 2 8 . 7 \\%$ by introducing a suitable content of p-terphenyl into PFA.Meanwhile, robust mechanical properties in the wet state $( \\mathrm { T S } = 2 2 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { M P a }$ $\\mathrm { E B = }$ $7 1 . 9 \\%$ ）and durable alkaline stability (after soaking in $2 \\ \\mathrm { M \\ N a O H }$ at $8 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for $1 4 4 0 \\mathrm { h }$ ,cationic groups remained at $9 3 \\%$ )ofPFTA-20 can well meet the harsh high temperature alkaline working environment of AEMWE.The PTFA-2O-based AEMWE achieved a high current density of $4 . 9 \\mathrm { A } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at $2 \\mathrm { v }$ and stable operation for $2 2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { h }$ with a slow voltage rising rate of $7 7 \\mu \\mathrm { V h } ^ { - 1 }$ in $1 \\mathrm { A } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ constant current model (1 M KOH, $8 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ .In summary,biphenyl and $p$ -triphenyl were introduced into PFA to construct PFBA and PFTA polymer structures,which shed light on the relationship between structure and performance in AEM.The developed AEMs should havea wide application in the AEMWE.
